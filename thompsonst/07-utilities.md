# Utilities

## Assemble Connect

Assemble provides Assemble Connect as a platform for tenants to manage their accounts in the embedded power, internet and hot water services.

## Electricity

Electricity is supplied through Voltio. More information about building's power system (including the solar panels) is avaialble on the website: https://assemble.com.au/projects/15-thompson-street-kensington

## Hot Water

Hot Water is generated on site with power supplied through Voltio. The quality is modest, with periodic reports from tenants of poor or inconsistent delivery, usually addressed by Assembled when reported to them.

## Water

As part of the Greater Western Water service area, the building is subject to what some refer to as the [GWW billing debacle](https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/media-centre/greater-western-water-customers-receive-130-million-redress-package-after-billing-failures). More information from GWW themselves [here](https://www.gww.com.au/accounts-billing/billing-updates).

When first delivered, the building didn't have individual water meters (possibly due to the above.) These were install months later - but due to the above, Thompson St tenants still haven't received their first water bill.

## Internet

### The Good

Thompson St comes configured with a very newbie-friendly integrated internet solution - each apartment has its own built-in wifi access point, connected to the embedded infrastructure. This also includes public access points in a few places, and the ability to log into your own account in shared spaces like the common area.

### The Bad

Despite promises to the contrary, tenants are locked into the embedded system - they can't access normal NBN service. Instead they're subject to the modest reliability, mediocre pricing and minimal feature-set of the embedded provider (now 'Rush Broadband', previously known as Gigafy.)

### What You Get

Rush provides a small range of price points, typical for domestic consumption. They provide bare-bones features (limited port forwarding, static IP features, for an extra monthly fee) configured through their user portal, not the Assemble Connect portal.

The wifi APs provided are similarly barebones (no local traffic permitted, so normal use of something like a Chromecast won't work.) But this can all be addressed by plugging in your own wifi AP, suitably configured. (Note also that the apartments have networking patch connections, from the area where the integrated AP is to other rooms/areas - so adding your own AP might also allow you to provide better wifi reception if your internet usage is spread around your apartment, away from wherever the integrated AP is.)
