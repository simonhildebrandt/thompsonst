# 15/27 Thompson St

## Introduction

15/27 Thompson St is a 199-apartment building between Thompson St and Stubbs St in Kensington. Built by Hacer for Assemble, the first tenants moved in mid 2024. Originally promoted as a rent-to-buy project, Assemble is now also including direct rentals in the project (see also [Renting vs Buying]).

Curiously, the building also includes Assemble's own offices (nominally labelled as '19 Thompson St') on the north side of the [Pocket Park], opposite the [Common Room]. Despite being at the heart of one of their own buildings, it's purely a business space - they provide no facility to engage with the tenants in the building (no service counter, etc).

## This Guide

As with all new apartment buildings, Thompson St has a few idiosyncracies. This guide was created to help answer a few of the more common questions we regularly see asked (particularly in the [WhatsApp Group].)

This guide isn't official, and isn't connected to Assemble in any way. We'll try to keep it as up to date as possible, and always recommend [checking for the newest version](http://thompsonst.requisite.link/index.html). Fixes and ideas for new sections very welcome! The source material to build (or improve) this document is available [here](https://github.com/simonhildebrandt/thompsonst).
