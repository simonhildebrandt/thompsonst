# 15/27 Thompson St

## Introduction

15/27 Thompson St is a 199-apartment building between Thompson St and Stubbs St in Kensington. Built by Hacer for Assemble, the first tenants moved in mid 2024. Originally promoted as a rent-to-buy project, Assemble is now also including direct rentals in the project (see also [Renting vs Buying]).

## This Guide

As with all new apartment buildings, Thompson St has a few idiosyncracies. This guide was created to help answer a few of the more common questions we regularly see asked (particularly in the [WhatsApp Group].)

This guide isn't official, and isn't connected to Assemble in any way. We'll try to keep it as up to date as possible, and always recommend checking for the newest version. Fixes and ideas for new sections very welcome!
