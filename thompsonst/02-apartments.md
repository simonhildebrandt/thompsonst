# Basics

Thompson St apartments are arranged across 7 floors in a 'C' shape around a central west-facing space (referred to as the [Pocket Park]) varying in size from small 'studio' variants, through larger two and three bedroom configurations.

Apartments feature built-in reverse-cycle [Airconditioners], small closet 'European-style' [Laundries] and [Balconies] - other points of interest are the [Door Closers] and the [Built-In Robe Shelving]. (For information about the built-in wifi, look at [Internet].)

## Airconditioners

Thompson St air conditioners are Fujitsu split-systems, with the main unit mounted on the roof of the building, plumbed down to each apartment individually, with one or more devices installed in bedrooms and/or living areas.

### Usage

The air conditioner units can be a little confusing to use, particularly if you have more than one. Particularly, they don't like different devices in the same split system being set to different modes (think fan in the living area, cooling in the master bedroom) and might appear to refuse to start if configured that way. They can also be temperamental about their filters (flashing a red light that requires a button press on the remote to clear) and if your apartment is too close to the head unit, you might hear significant gurgling noises, due to insufficient refrigerant in the too-short pipes.

## Laundries

The primary surprise with the in-apartment laundries is: the light (which engages the ventilation fan) must be turned on for the power points inside the laundry to become active. This isn't displayed anywhere, and wasn't clearly communicated to new tenants when they moved in, causing a lot of confusion.

## Balconies

Balconies have a 'flow-under' tiling solution similar to other common areas like the [Pocket Park]. Water _does_ pass under the tiles, it _can_ get dirty/smelly under there, and Assemble _does_ consider it your responsibility to carefully lever them up and clean underneath. They provide no guidance on how to do this safely, or what tools to use.

## Door Closers

A familiar sound around the building is the crash of an apartment door slamming closed. Each front door is fitted with a closer, but they're often configured very aggressively. This video includes guidance on how to tweak them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Q87w8uhwg

Note: I'm not kidding about 'aggressively' - ensure children and pets are kept safe around closing doors, particularly in high wind.

## Built-In Robe Shelving

### TL;DR

For various reasons the shelves in your built-in robes might be missing or an unexpected configuration. Ask in the [WhatsApp Group] for help finding shelves that suit you if you don't have ones that serve your needs.

### History

When tenants first moved in in 2024, we were surprised to discover our built-in robes had cavities for shelves, but no actual shelves. When asked, Assemble explained that the spaces were configured to be the size of standard IKEA shelves, and rather than a cost-saving measure on their part, it was an opportunity for tenants to customise those spaces with whatever types of shelves they wanted.

First problem - the 'size' part of the above wasn't true - IKEA offers a large number of general purpose shelf solutions, and none fit the (roughly 51cm x 46xm) space Hacer had assembled (no pun intended). It took Assemble many months to acknowledge this, though.

Second problem - the expense and hassle of sourcing their own shelves wasn't on the radar for most new tenants. At one stage an enterprising tenant actually bulk ordered custom cut shelves from a plywood supplier, and another group discovered that cutting down IKEA basket rack tracks allowed you to use those baskets in the provided space.

Ultimately (possibly shamed by the the mix of complaints and antagonistic entrepreneurialism) Assemble relented, and began a long, slow process of measuring all of the built-in robes, to provide their _own_ shelving.

### Now, and solutions

As a result of the above, we're now in quite a strange situation. Despite largely homogeneous design throughout the building, the status of the built-in robe shelves in any given apartment is basically a dice roll. Assemble eventually provided shelves for every apartment, but did the tenants at the time pick them up? Did they install any/some/all of them? Did they purchase other shelves, or baskets, and use them instead? Having potentially paid their own money for shelves early on, do some tenants feel entitled to take those shelves with them, leaving the space empty? (That seems to have been reported by at least one new tenant recently.)

Assemble hasn't audited the current status, and offers no guidance on what to do if you have too many/too few/inconvenient shelving. The community has pools of shelves and baskets that they continue to offer under various arrangements - please jump into the [WhatsApp Group] and ask for help if you need it.
