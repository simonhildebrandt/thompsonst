# Thompson St

This repo holds an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with tenant notes for the [Thompson St Assemble project](https://assemble.com.au/projects/15-thompson-street-kensington), and a Pandoc workflow to compile that content into a convenient PDF.

## Building

The `.tool-versions` file lists suggested versions of Node and Yarn to run the compilation scripts.

`yarn build` will compile the PDF and put it in `/output`;

`yarn watch` runs the build command in a continually updating mode using `onchange`.

## Contributing

Currently the easiest way to contribute is to create a pull request against the Github repo with the suggested changes.

Alternately, [find the markdown file for the chapter you'd like to change](https://github.com/simonhildebrandt/thompsonst/tree/main/thompsonst), modify the text and email it to [simonhildebrandt@gmail.com](mailto:simonhildebrandt@gmail.com).
